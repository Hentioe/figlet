# Figlet

This project aims to fully implement the [FIGfont spec](http://www.jave.de/figlet/figfont.html) in Elixir.

Based on the work of Patrick Gillespie for [Javascript Figlet](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `figlet` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir

  ]
end
```
